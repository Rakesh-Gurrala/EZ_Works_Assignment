# Smart Assistant for Research Summarization

A command-line interface (CLI) tool for simulating a smart assistant that summarizes documents, answers user questions, and provides evaluation challenges‚Äîall without requiring an internet connection or external API access.

## Features

* üîç **Ask Anything**: Ask questions based on the document's content and get simulated answers.
* ‚úÖ **Challenge Mode**: Automatically evaluate simulated user responses against predefined questions.
* üß† **Summarization**: Extract a short summary from the document.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Offline Simulation**: Fully operational without OpenAI API or external modules.

## Usage

Run the script using Python 3:

```bash
python main.py [mode]
```

Where `[mode]` is optional:

* `1`: Ask Anything mode (default)
* `2`: Challenge Me mode

Example:

```bash
python main.py 2
```

## Project Structure
